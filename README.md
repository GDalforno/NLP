# Named Entity Recognition for Brazilian Legal Text

The repository contains the code for the experiments to build up an intelligent system to perform named entity recognition on documents provided by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. Due to the secrecy of the dataset, the code is not fully reproducible, although the exploratory data analysis and the sequence tagging framework codes are still worth applying to other NER tasks.

The partial results are shown on the mid-report.pdf and the final version is available at final-report.pdf.
